# Taskstodo-React-Redux-Hooks

The purpose of the page is to maintain records for two resources (Todos and Users).  

The user can perform functions like list, create, read, update and delete on each of the resources. The layout of the page is shown in the diagram below.

I have implemented Users Lists using Hoooks and Tasks using Redux.

New users can be added with a valid emailid and can be edited.

Tasks can only be added and also marked as Done and can also delete the task.

!!!! There is no link between them, they are two seperate components :DD
